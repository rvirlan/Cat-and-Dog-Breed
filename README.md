# Cat-and-Dog-Breed
This is a data analysis of the cat and dogs breeds dataset. Excel has been used to analyse the data like
displaying the total counts of cats per fur type, displaying total counts of dogs per group1 category, to display the top and bottom breeds with 1-10 popularity.
To create a pivot chart for cat breeds and pivot chart for dog breeds.
I have created a PowerPoint Presentation based on the summaries, pivots, and other data analytics you have completed using the given data.
